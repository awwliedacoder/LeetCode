# LeetCode
One LeetCode challenge a day... keeps the unemployment away?

## For 'shits and giggles'
I just wanted to challenge myself and force myself to use different languages, I intend to try and solve everyday a LeetCode challenge without using the same language in a row.
-> esque,

I used Python today, I won't use Python tommorrow.

Intensions are to learn currently.

*TypeScript
*Java
